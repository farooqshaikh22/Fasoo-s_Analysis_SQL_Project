# Fasoo's Analysis SQL Project

## Overview
The Fasoo's Analysis SQL project focuses on analyzing data from Faasos, an online restaurant platform. The dataset includes tables such as `driver`, `ingredients`, `rolls`, `driver_order`, and `customer_orders`, providing valuable insights into drivers, ingredients, rolls, order details, and customer behavior.

2. **Unique Customer Orders:** Determines the count of unique customer orders.

3. **Successful Orders by Drivers:** Analyzes the count of successful orders delivered by each driver.
4. **Total Rolls Delivered:** Breaks down the count of each type of roll delivered.
5. **Veg and Non-Veg Rolls per Customer:** Identifies the number of veg and non-veg rolls ordered by each customer.
6. **Maximum Rolls in a Single Order:** Finds the order with the highest number of rolls.

7. **Customer Order Changes:** Investigates the count of delivered rolls with at least one change per customer.
8. **Rolls with Exclusions and Extras:** Explores the count of rolls delivered with both exclusions and extras.
